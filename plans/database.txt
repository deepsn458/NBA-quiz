Req 1:- Retrieve a question at random
Req 2:- Retrieve two options for the question 
      - Total 4 options for the question
      - Option 1: correct option
      - Option 2: 1/3 randomely selected from incorrect option
Req3: Whether the correct option is at button A or Button B should be random
Req 4: When button is clicked:
        - Value compared to correct option
        - if the same:
            - +1 added to "correct answers
        - else
            - +1 added to wrong answers
Req 5: New question should be loaded (using JS)
        - The loaded question cannot be the same as any previous question

Specification (Only 1 webpage, no JS)
1) Retrieve a question at random from question table and set displayed to true
    q = Questions.query.filter_by(id=random.randInt(0,n), displayed=False)
    q.displayed = true
2) Select correct option that has same question id as question
    o1 = Options.query.filter_by(question_id= q.id, correct_incorrect=True).first()
3) Select incorrect option at random, that has same question id as question
    Inefficient version:
        int = randInt(0,2)
        if int == 0: 
            o2 = Options.query.filter_by(question_id=q.id,correct_incorrect=False).first()
        elif int == 1:
            o2 = Options.query.filter_by(question_id=q.id, correct_incorrect=False).limit(2)[1]
        else:
            o2 = Options.query.filter_by(question_id=q.id, correct_incorrect=False).limit(3)[2]
    
    Efficient version (may not work):
        o2 =  Options.query.filter_by(question_id=q.id, correct_incorrect=false).order_by(func.random()).limit(1)
        
4) Randomely assign both to a button
    btn_id = randInt(0,1);
    return btn_id, o1.option_name, and o2.option_name to template
    In template (With Jinja): if btn_id=0: 
                                o1 in btn1, o2 in btn2
                              else:
                                o1 in btn2, o2 in btn1
5) button submits option when button is clicked 
    Both buttons are assigned a name of 'response'
    option = request.form.get('response')
6)Retrieve submitted option and question and add them to the Responses table
    response = Responses(question_id=q.id, option_id=option.id, correct_incorrect=option.correct_incorrect)

At the end:
7) Get the sum of the correct and incorrect answers
    total_correct = Responses.query.filter_by(correct_incorrect=True);
    total_wrong = Responses.query.filter_by(correct_incorrect=False);

8) Clears the responses table
    db.session.query(Responses).delete()
    db.session.commit()
